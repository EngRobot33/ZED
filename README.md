## Installation

* First of all clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/EngRobot33/ZED.git
```
* Then, we need a virtual environment you can create like this:
```
virtualenv venv
```
* Activate it with the command below:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
* After that, you must install all the packages in `requirements.txt` file in project directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Create a `.env` file in root directory and add your created config:
```python
SECRET_KEY = 'Your secret key generated by https://djecrety.ir'
DEBUG = 'Project debug status'
```
* After that, migration:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
* Then make sure that Redis is actually running on your machine:
```
redis-server
```
* That's finished! Now you can run the project:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
