## Installation

* First of all clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/EngRobot33/ZED.git
```
* Then, we need a virtual environment you can create like this:
```
virtualenv venv
```
* Activate it with the command below:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
* After that, you must install all the packages in `requirements.txt` file in project directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Create a `.env` file in root directory and add your created config like `.env.sample`:
```python
SECRET_KEY = 'Your secret key generated by https://djecrety.ir'
DEBUG = 'Project debug status'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = 'Host/Domain names list that this site can serve for e.g ['*'] allows all hosts'
```
* After that, migration:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
* Then make sure that Redis is actually running on your machine:
```
redis-server
```
* Now you should install all the packages in `package.json` file. Just make sure npm is installed:
```
npm install
```
* That's finished! Now you can run the project:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
## Run with docker
* You need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  
 
  

* Then clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/EngRobot33/ZED.git
```
* Create a `.env` file in root directory and add your created config like `.env.sample`:
```python
SECRET_KEY = 'Your secret key generated by https://djecrety.ir'
DEBUG = 'Project debug status'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = 'Host/Domain names list that this site can serve for e.g ['*'] allows all hosts'
DB_USER=zed
DB_PASSWORD=zed1234
```

* That's finished! Now you can run the project:
```
docker compose up -d 
```
