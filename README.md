## Installation

* First of all clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EngRobot33/ZED.git
```

* Then, we need a virtual environment you can create like this:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

* Activate it with the command below:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

* After that, you must install all the packages in `requirements.txt` file in project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* You should install PostgreSQL and its dependecies:

  ```shell
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib
  ```

* Now setup your database in PostgreSQL shell:
  * Open PostgreSQL shell:

    ```shell
    sudo -u postgres psql
    ```

  * Create database:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
    ```

  * Create user:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER <database_user> WITH PASSWORD '<database_password>';
    ```

  * Grant all privileges to zed database user:

    ```sql
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database_name> TO <database_user>;
    ```

* Create a `.env` file in root directory and add your created config like `.env.sample`:

```python
SECRET_KEY = 'Your secret key generated by https://djecrety.ir'
DEBUG = 'Project debug status'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = 'Host/Domain names list that this site can serve for e.g ['*'] allows all hosts'

DB_NAME = '<database_name>'
DB_USER = '<database_user>'
DB_PASS = '<database_password>'
DB_HOST = '<database_host>'
DB_PORT = '<database_port>'
```

* After that, migration:

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

* Then make sure that Redis is actually running on your machine:

```bash
redis-server
```

* Now you should install all the packages in `package.json` file. Just make sure npm is installed:

```bash
npm install
```

* That's finished! Now you can run the project:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## Run with docker

* You need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  
* Then clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EngRobot33/ZED.git
```

* Create a `.env` file in root directory and add your created config like `.env.sample`:

```python
SECRET_KEY = 'Your secret key generated by https://djecrety.ir'
DEBUG = 'Project debug status'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = 'Host/Domain names list that this site can serve for e.g ['*'] allows all hosts'

DB_NAME = '<database_name>'
DB_USER = '<database_user>'
DB_PASS = '<database_password>'
DB_HOST = db
DB_PORT = <database_port>
```

* Make sure to match the database environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` too and create the database as mentioned before.

```yml
environment:
  - POSTGRES_USER=zed_user
  - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=zed_password
  - POSTGRES_DB=zed_database
#
#
ports:
  - "5432:5432"
```

* That's finished! Now you can run the project:

```bash
docker compose up -d 
```
